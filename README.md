When you clone this repository, yo have to install dependecies in each of the folders, because each one is a node.js proyect
```bash
  npm install
```

After having prepared the proyect, these commands are available in `package.json`.
```bash
  npm run dev #run server on port 3000 (CLI) and port 8080 (Server)
